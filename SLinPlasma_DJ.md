**What is the Scaling law(Buckingham $\Pi$ theorem)?**

In engineering, applied mathematics, and physics, the Buckingham $pi$ theorem is a key theorem in dimensional analysis[@b14]. 
It is a formalization of Rayleigh's method of dimensional analysis. 

Loosely, the theorem states that if there is a physically meaningful equation involving a certain number, n, of physical variables, and k is the rank of the dimensional matrix, then the original expression is equivalent to an equation involving a set of p = n − k  dimensionless parameters constructed from the original variables: it is a scheme for nondimensionalization. 

This provides a method for computing sets of dimensionless parameters from the given variables, even if the form of the equation is still unknown. -[WIKI:Buckingham $\Pi$ theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_%CF%80_theorem).

<!--However, the choice of dimensionless parameters is not unique: Buckingham's theorem only provides a way of generating sets of dimensionless parameters, and will not choose the most 'physically meaningful'.
* The pi–theorem was first proved by French mathematician J. Bertrand[1] in 1878. Bertrand considers only special cases of problems from electrodynamics and heat conduction, but his article contains in distinct terms all basic ideas of modern proof of the pi–theorem and clear indication of the use of the pi–theorem for modelling physical phenomena. The technique of pi–theorem’s usage (“the method of dimensions”) became widely known due to the works of Rayleigh (the first application of the pi–theorem in the general case[2] to the dependence of pressure drop in a pipe upon governing parameters probably dates back to 1892,[3] a heuristic proof with the use of series expansion, to 1894[4]).

Formal generalization of the pi–theorem for the case of arbitrary number of quantities was for the first time given by A. Vaschy in 1892,[5] and later and, apparently, independently, by A. Federman,[6] D. Riabouchinsky[7] in 1911 and by E. Buckingham[8] in 1914.-->

**The example of Scaling law's application in Fluid(Blast wave):**
Using scraps of paper to estimate the power of the atomic bomb-[Quora:How did Fermi estimate the power of the Trinity bomb?](http://www.quora.com/Physics/How-did-Fermi-estimate-the-power-of-the-Trinity-bomb#), 
and done it that Based on those photographs which published in a popular magazine by Taylor, G.I.[@t50] at Trinity.
![Picture of the blast, captured by Berlyn Brixner were used by G.I. Taylor to estimate the yield of the device during the Trinity test](fig/Trinity_Test_Fireball_25ms.jpg)

## Solar Radar 
History of Solar Radar which is using radar technology to explore **solar corona**:
 
-proposed by Kerr in 1952 to probe corona around 1.5 $R_S$

-detection at 25 MHz at Stanford in 1959 - SNR marginal

-daily observations at 38 MHz at El Campo, 1961 through 1969

-no detection at 50 MHz at Jicamarca in 1964 

-marginal detection at 40 MHz at Arecibo in 1967 - unpublished

## Plasma Stealth
Plasma stealth is a proposed process to use ionized gas (plasma) to reduce the radar cross section (RCS) of an aircraft. 

Interactions between electromagnetic radiation and ionized gas have been extensively studied for many purposes, including concealing aircraft from radar as stealth technology. 

Various methods might plausibly be able to form a layer or cloud of plasma around a vehicle to deflect or absorb radar, from simpler electrostatic or radio frequency(RF) discharges to more complex laser discharges.

## Microwave diagnostic in Fusion 
Microwave diagnostic in Fusion is relatively mature.

For example, Clairet, F. et al. studied Edge density profile measurements by X-mode reflectometry on Tore Supra[@cbcps01], 

Laviron, C. et al. studied Reflectometry techniques for density profile measurements on fusion plasmas[@ldms96].

Some books also mentioned the above content[@oz00, @h05, @d05].

## Plasma propulsion
A plasma propulsion engine is a type of electric propulsion that generates thrust from a quasi-neutral plasma. 
These exist in many forms, and some of it related with interreaction between **radio waves** and plasma. For example:

* A Helicon Double Layer Thruster uses **radio waves** to create a plasma and a magnetic nozzle to focus and accelerate the plasma away from the rocket engine.

* VASIMR, or Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket, works by using **radio waves** to ionize a propellant into a plasma and then a magnetic field to accelerate the plasma out of the back of the rocket engine to generate thrust.
 
## Scaling Laws In Plasma
Recently, Ryutov, D.D. studied Criteria for Scaled Laboratory Simulations of Astrophysical MHD Phenomena[@rdr00], 

and Falize, E. et al. researched Similarity Properties and Scaling Laws of Radiation Hydrodynamic Flows in Laboratory Astrophysics[@fmb11],

and Coker, Rob given an introduction of Laboratory astrophysics and scaling[@c10].

| Reflection  | $\Uparrow$  | $\Downarrow$   |    $\Uparrow$        | $\Uparrow$ ?      |
|Absorbability| $\Downarrow$|  $\Uparrow$    |   $\Downarrow$       | ?                 |

  : The propagation of Radio waves in plasma, $\Uparrow$ means strengthen the related effects, $\Downarrow$ means weaken the related effects. 

## open questions
* Which results of Microwave diagnostic in Fusion could apply to solar radar for **detect CMEs or asteroids near the Sun**?

* Which results of Microwave diagnostic in Fusion could apply to plasma stealth for **find aliens**? 

* Which results of Microwave diagnostic in Fusion could apply to Plasma Propulsion for **arrive to alpha Centauri or Barnard's Star**?
